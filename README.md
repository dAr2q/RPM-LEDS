# RPM LED for F1 24 based on ESP32 and WS2812

Based on [f1-24-udp](https://github.com/MacManley/f1-24-udp)

Uses FastLED from [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)

# Status

- Currently works on ESP32-WROOM and ESP32-C3 Super Mini (could work on ESP8266 but dont have any to test)

# ToDo
- Mini Webserver for entering SSID and Password
- Before connecting to WiFi create AP to enter Webserver
- if EN Button pressed erase Wifi Settings and open AP

# Bugs

- WiFi does not always connect (so after trying for a few seconds the ESP reboots "not pretty but works")
